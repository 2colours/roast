## This test file was removed from roast/master some time around this commit
## was made: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/14d757131159b536d64447f567bc9a8324a271ca
##
## The reason this dummy exists is to silence missing file warnings in spectest
## run, and we can't remove it from the spectest file list because this file in
## its old form is still part of 6.c-errata
