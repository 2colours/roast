## This test file was superceeded by a bunch of other test files added during
## 2017.05-2017.07 period.
## The reason this dummy exists is to silence missing file warnings in spectest
## run, and we can't remove it from the spectest file list because this file in
## its old form is still part of 6.c-errata
